gene_level_calls
GISTIC_analysis


The first 4 folders/files contains data on each individual sample
gene_level_calls and GISTIC_analysis consists of samples combined into one file


consensus_sv contains the structural variants


The data folder also contains the ID mapping for ICGC and TCGA donors, as well as the outcome response of platinum therapy for each donor.

id_and_response_with_pcawg_overview includes data with ids combined with therapy response and PCAWG overview data

id_and_therapy_response includes data with ids combined with therapy response only

Ids contain the ids of interest only

pcawg_overview_data contains other clinical features obtained in the pcawg study

chromosomal_instability_data contains the CN signatures from the paper "A pan-cancer compendium of chromosomal instability"

evolution_and_heterogeneity contains data on whole genome duplication timing and the signature changes obtained from the paper "The evolutionary history of 2658 cancers"

signatures_paper_data contains the CN signatures from the paper "Signatures of copy number alterations in human cancer"

snv_gene_level_calls contains data on the mutations in each gene for single nucleotide variations
